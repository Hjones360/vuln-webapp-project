# Vulnerable Web App (Flask Security Training Project)

This is a deliberately vulnerable Flask-based web application created for hands-on cybersecurity practice and OWASP Top 10 training. It includes basic user authentication, image uploads, personal galleries, and text-based post creation — all intentionally coded without validations or security protections.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This app is intentionally insecure and should only be used in controlled environments for ethical hacking and security education. **Do not deploy it in production.**

## 🛠 Features

- User registration and login system
- User profile page displaying username and email
- Password change functionality
- Image upload and personal gallery views
- Simple post creation with SQLite database storage
- Deployed using PythonAnywhere with WSGI configuration

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Frontend:** HTML, Jinja2 Templates
- **Hosting:** PythonAnywhere
- **Tools/Concepts:** Linux CLI, Bash, Git, GitHub, WSGI, OWASP Top 10

## 💡 Learning Goals

This project helped me understand:

- How insecure web apps are built and where vulnerabilities arise
- Common threats like SQL Injection, insecure file uploads, and IDOR
- Secure development lifecycle and how to plan mitigation
- End-to-end deployment using a cloud-based Linux environment
